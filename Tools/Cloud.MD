# Cloud Services

At this point I have worked with all of the major cloud services AWS, Azure, Google Cloud. They all provide you an easier way to maintain
servers and services, than doing it manually. However, it is easy to rack up a large bill if you are not careful.

I'm not a devops person, so I don't know everything about all the services and how to automate all of them, I know some people like
Terraform and some don't.

What I've used mostly for integration and automation, and the commandline tools and the SDKs, The commandline tool for each seem to be
fairly consistent, work and have at least semi decent documentation for all the major cloud services.

The SDKS range in quality.

I've found that AWS has the best SDK for it v2+, because once you understand its setup everything is mostly the same and fairly consistent.
The documentation is somewhere between ok and crap depending on what part of the SDK you are using.

Azure seemed to have good APIs for the most part, but in some cases it was easier to find the documentation for the commandline. That
was the issue I found with Azure, trying to find the right documentation.

Google Clouds API seem somewhat restrictive with my first encounter with it, and it seems like the CLI, seems better documented, easier to use
and had more options.

I think Azure was the easiest to ues and gave you more out of the box, AWS seemed the most mature with the best SDK, and Google cloud
just seems mediocre. They all have there complications, where you will say to yourself, why can't anything just be easy? The answer to
that is there is a whole industry set up to make the cloud services easy, and you can, may an exorbitant amount of money for those services.
