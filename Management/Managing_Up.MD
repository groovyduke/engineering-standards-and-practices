# Managing Up
Hopefully you'll never be put into the position of having to manage up, but some of the methods of coping with bad management can be helpful
in general

## What makes a good manager
A good manager is one who looks to remove obstacles from your path, by getting you the tools you need, the time of the person you need to
talk to, figuring out who you need to talk to, giving you feedback, listening to your feedback, and making decisions based on that.
A good manager will share and give credit to the team they lead. A good manager will advocate for their team, and push back when appropriate.
A good manager will have empathy for their team and want them to succeed learn, grow and will not be threatened by their team knowing more than they do.


## Setting Expectations
When you don't have a good manager it is often good to set expectations, maybe pad your estimates, because it's better to come in under
than go over. Missed deadlines are a fact of engineering, because of unforeseen consequences, a good manager won't hold this against you, but
a bad manager might.

## Prototyping
Making prototypes can be a good way to show something, before fully committing to a given path so they management can tell you what they like
about it and don't like about it so you can fix that in the final product.

## The illusion of choice
A lot of times bad managers do not like be presented with one option especially if it's not perfect. However, if you present one
good option with a lot of support and one bad option for them to reject, they might be more receptive. Keep in mind this can blow up in
your face if they pick the bad option.
