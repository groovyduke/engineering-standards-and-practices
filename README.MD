# Engineering Standards, Practices and Musings

This is a  template for a landing page and engineering standards, practices, and my own musings about various engineering related topics.
I'm collecting these thoughts and standards here, because I have scattered notes about this subject, have had numerous conversations,
and have added these to various company wikis over the years. However, I wanted my own collection that I could take and evolve independently 
of one opportunity to another, and that anyone could pick up and use if they so choose.

I decided that I wanted to make this public domain, so feel free to clone it and reload it in your own repo, so you can modify it without it being a public fork.

If you do take this as a template I suggest that you keep the following statement:

This is a living document that should periodically be revisited, updated, and changed to reflect your current standards, not all 
standards will make sense for all organizations, and what makes sense today might not make sense tomorrow. Don't just blindly apply these
standards question them if they don't make sense, and update them as need be in your development organization.


These are my "good ideas" for engineering standards and practices:

    Rufus: "He said mankind got it all wrong by taking a good idea and building a belief structure on it."
    
    Bethany: Having beliefs isn't good?
    
    Rufus: "I just think itâ€™s better to have ideas. I mean, you can change an idea, changing a belief is trickier. People die for it, people kill for it.
    
    From the movie Dogma 1999

or where I selected the wrong word from the spell checker without realizing it.
