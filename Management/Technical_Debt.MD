# Technical Debt

All projects have technical debt, be it from cutting corners to go faster at a startup, not making time to upgrade libraries/frameworks,
legacy code bases, bad practices that snuck into the code or whatever else. Management should allow a percentage of development time to be 
allocated to paying down technical debt. If management does not make time for paying down technical deb it will continually pile up over 
time and get worse. As technical debt piles up and gets worse you will be forced to pay interest on the technical debt in the form of slower 
development, more bugs, and possibly security vulnerabilities.

If you can make it a regular habit to pay down technical debt early on you can negate its negative effects.
