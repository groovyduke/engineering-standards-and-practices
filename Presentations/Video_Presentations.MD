# Video Presentations

Here is a collection of video presentations that I think are either thought-provoking, funny or both. I may not agree with every idea in
the videos, but I think this collection has a lot of value:

## Thought provoking:
* [CodeAesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic/videos) - This is the current list of videos from the CodeAesthetic YouTube channel 
These videos are well thought out and relatively short, dealing with ideas of nesting, naming, abstractions, etc.
* [Larger Scale Software Development (and a Big Trap)](https://youtu.be/slV0zdUEYJw?si=BB-mkWM1mjnxuHiJ) Some good thoughts/ideas about Architecture.
* [The Thing No One Tells You About Microservices](https://youtu.be/yC6EEuxhglE?si=mDzBiGYOq4p9DIuh) Some good ideas about Micro services.
* [Stuart Halloway - Narcissistic Design](https://youtu.be/LEZv-kQUSi4?si=7EkKvvO_7gRejD88) Humorous view of bad practices.
* [Reacting to Controversial Opinions of Software Engineers](https://youtu.be/goy4lZfDtCE?si=LtAt8pWDypoWbjuU) Hot takes on controversial
software engineering topics, but I think this a balanced talk about these with some humor injected.
* [Zed A. Shaw - The Web Will Die When OOP Dies](https://youtu.be/_CEBG_s92P8?si=n4Y7daljZScHUDZg) This has a lot of sarcastic humor injected
into it so don't take it comepletely at face value. However, I think it has a lot of good points woven into it.
* [Keynote: the top 10 ways to scam the modern american programmer, by Zed A Shaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47FOiwXDh8&list=PL2LtD8ALnyTjDy-O6sBHsxYckYmiJ4VSH&index=5)
Another one by Zeb so again sarcastic humor but interesting points to think about.
* [Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on git](https://youtu.be/4XpnKHJAok8?si=Jt5OToMirh7uo-oo) Interesting talk about GIT. 
* [Programming Memes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjN6kg4diP0OQ3NRIIZLmQaspiqxtLtYQ) Just for the lulz
* [The Expert (Short Comedy Sketch)](https://youtu.be/BKorP55Aqvg?si=Rxtqoi0_0ZVWXvH7)

## Misc Tutorials:
* [How The 'awk' Command Made Me A 10x Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSpuZVb164&list=PL2LtD8ALnyTjDy-O6sBHsxYckYmiJ4VSH&index=7&t=417s) The title is clickbait trash but in case you want to learn a little about write only code.
