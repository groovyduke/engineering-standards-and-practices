# Learning

As an engineer you should always be looking to learn more. Our industry is always changing and evolving and while it is impossible to know
everything you should keep any eye our for how things are evolving, what tools people are using, what languages they are using, and
what frameworks are they using. Just keep in mind just because something is popular doesn't make it the best.

A lot of times when I start doing something if it seems like a more manual process I will google it just to see if there is a better way
and API I don't know about. I usually keep some notes and examples to things I do, because I also don't try to memorize commands
and APIs, that will happen naturally if I use them repeatedly and the once I only use on occasion I will forget and have to look up
again anyway.

If there is a conference that has talks that you are interested, and you've never been to one before, see if you can go, and maybe get your
employer to pay for it. The experience of going to a conference meeting like-minded people, talking about technology and learning from the
talks themselves can be a very valuable. Unfortunately Covid killed a lot of conferences and not many have comeback.

Meetups and JUG meetings can be similar to conferences but on a smaller scale. They can be good places to learn of new things and network.

Slack, Discord and the like can be other places to go to ask questions and talk to people about the language, framework, or library that
you are interested in.

YouTube is another resource where you can find prerecorded talks, presentations, and tutorials. If you find some that are really long, and
you don't want to take that time try watching them at 2x speed.
