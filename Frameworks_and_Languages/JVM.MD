# JVM

For this repository I have focused on JVM-based languages as a lot of my school exposure and work experience has involved Java, and 
eventually Groovy.  Java wasn't the first programming language I was exposed to. My programming language journey looks something like this:
C64 Basic, Apple Basic, C++, Pic ASM, Intel ASM, Java, Scheme, C, more Java, Python, more Java, Pearl, JS, Groovy

Through early exposure to computers and school, I was exposed to a variety of programming languages, but towards the end, Java became dominant.
At that point, I liked Java because it seemed easier and I could write less low-level code and get more done. Don't get me wrong I do
appreciate the exposure to things like Assembly and C, it's just not where I wanted to spend most of my time. 

After School in my professorial experience, I started off with Java, but then was exposed to Python, which opened my eyes to  things I was
missing in Java, specifically features that could make coding easier, and more expressive. I did have to do some more Java, and some JS, with
a little exposure to Perl between. However then I was introduced to Groovy. To me Groovy was like Python, very powerful and expressive,
but also more familiar and could leverage everything I already knew about Java and its ecosystem. For me, the pairing of the JVM, Groovy, 
and frameworks like Grails/Micronaut have enabled my career over the past 12+ years and allowed me to be more productive than I think
I otherwise would be.

I do keep an eye out though, to see what new or different languages and frameworks there are out there, to see what new ideas I can pick up. 
However when I look at them from the perspective of what do I gain, and what do I lose from adopting them. I have looked at Ruby, Python,
Elixir, Kotlin. JS and for the type of programming I do there is not enough, or I lose too much for me to want to switch to them. Although
I do keep an open mind and maybe someday in the future, a new language will come along, that will be worth really diving into.

More recently going from Grails to Micronaut I do lose convention over configuration, but gain better memory efficiency, startup time, more 
cloud/microservices features, a platform that has more people involved in evolving it and I still get to use Groovy. In this case, the loss 
may only be temporary and Convention over configuration could become a feature enabled through Groovy.
