# Hiring
Hiring good people is hard you will often hear the quote:

    "It's hard to hire good people these days."

It's actually always hard to hire good people, regardless of economic trends. Finding good people that are not just referred to you takes 
time and consideration. You will have to pre-screen and have many interviews, you may have to use recruiters and none of that guarantees
you will find good people who will work well with your existing team.

When you are hiring you should have multiple people interview a candidate, and if one of them doesn't feel right about the candidate don't hire that person.
Hiring the wrong person can cost you more time, money, and aggravation than not hiring that person.

In Engineering adding more people doesn't always make things go faster, and it can actually slow things down. Engineers should not be looked
at as factors of production, i.e. engineering is not manufacturing. Most of what engineers do is thinking and problem-solving. So you 
want people who are good at learning, picking up new skills, and researching.  

# On Shore
I would prefer to have fewer on-shore developers than have a bigger team that includes a lot of offshore people. If you are an early startup
you will primarily want experienced engineers who can hit the ground running. Experience is expensive, however, with inexperienced developers,
you will have to put time and resources into mentoring them, and getting them the experiences that will make them good engineers. Startups
don't usually have that luxury of time.

If your company makes it out of the startup phase into a mid to large-size company then hiring entry-level engineers can be a good way to
go. Entry-level engineers can take on some of the menial tasks, and bug, while they are being mentored by more senior engineers. One advantage
of entry-level engineers is they may have a lot of ideas, some may be good/fresh as they are not encumbered with experience, however
since they don't have the experience they will not be able to tell the difference between good and bad ideas, which is where your 
experienced engineers come in to help guide and teach them.

Why you should spend time and resources teaching/mentoring engineers? Well, it's better to have engineers who know things and are continually learning,
that may leave one day, then engineers that don't know or learn new things and never go away.

Engineers will come and go from your business, which is just the nature of the industry at this point. If you want to keep engineers a bit
longer, these are things that can help although none of these alone will keep an engineer forever:
* Monetary/bonus/pay raise/profit sharing
* interesting projects to work on
* listening to their feedback and implementing suggestions when appropriate
* Limiting time-wasting meetings, not all meetings need all people involved
* Make sure they have the best tools the business can afford to do the job

# Off Shore and contractors
Offshore and contractors can be a double-edged sword, and you often get what you pay for. If you're looking to expand your engineering team
and do that cheaply a lot of companies will go with offshore. However, at the rate you're paying you are likely to get inexperienced 
entry-level engineers, that you will have to train to be effective. Also, regardless of if you try to integrate the offshore into your team and 
treat them as if they were part of it, they are contractors. Inexperienced contractors that you pay little for will do whatever you tell
them  no more or less, and matter how stupid that is. They will not push back even if that pushback is warranted. Offshore usually also
comes with a time difference, so you will have a narrow window to communicate with them, and anything they do while you are off you'll have
to deal with the next morning. For these reasons, cheap offshore can actually end up costing you more money in wasted time, writing exact
specs, doing more in-depth code reviews, and sometimes rewriting code.

Contractor just like offshore you get what you pay for. Sometimes it may be useful to bring in contractors to help with a problem that
your team can't figure out how to solve or to train them on new technology. Not everyone knows everything and sometimes it can be helpful
to bring in a ringer that you can't afford full-time or can't find to hire full-time.

# Frontend VS Backend VS Full Stack
Companies usually want experienced Full Stack developers because this makes everyone easily replaceable, but then you end up with a bunch
of jack of all trades/master of none working on your project. Usually, engineers specialize in either the front or backend, and you should
hire both for your project. Inexperienced entry-level engineers can be full stack as they have not specialized in an area yet, although
an experienced full stack developer that is good in both ends of the engineering is a unicorn, i.e. rare. In a startup what you may have
in the beginning to get going are engineers that specialize in one area, but can do the job of the other good enough and long enough till
you are able to hire dedicated backend and frontend members of your team.

# Process
Have at least one manager and a couple of engineers interview a candidate, to get a sense of if the person has the skills and can fit in
with your team. If you have a referral you might go through an abbreviated process to go faster, but in general
* Have a pre-screen call where you talk briefly about their experience, and see if it is worth bringing them "in" for an interview.
* Have several people interview the candidate. 
* Have them ask some coding-related questions and try to get a sense if they can work with the candidate
* Get all the interviewers together after and discuss if they think you should hire the candidate
* if one of the interviewers descents or is unsure don't hire that person keep looking.

## Questing Ideas

### Coding problem Fizz Buzz
You want to have a coding problem that is simple enough for them to do in an interview and doesn't require an IDE. This will allow you 
to see a bit how they think an attack a problem. You don't want the problem to be too hard as to fluster the candidate, because you won't
get much out of it other than a lot of wasted time. Fizz Buzz is usually a good candidate for this type of question.

### Recursion
Ask a question about trees or a file system, just to see if they understand the idea of recursion. Usually, if the candidate just says
recursion I cut them off and say that's good enough.

### Functional Programming
You may want to ask a functional programming question just to see if they are familiar with the basic concepts. While almost no one does
purely functional programming professionally, functional style programming can be very useful in certain situations and some functional 
aspects have been added to Java and were always a part of Groovy.

### Pubsub/Eventing/async
You may want to ask a question about pub-sub, events, and or async to see if they know some of the advantages and disadvantages.

### Coding Standards
Ask them if they were to come up with coding standards, what would they be? This is a good open-ended question to get an idea what 
they value.

### Continuous Learning
You may want to ask a question around what they do to keep up with technology, do they read articles, play with open source, or anything
like that. Ask if they are open to learning the stack that you are using, and in general, have an outlook that continuous learning is important.
