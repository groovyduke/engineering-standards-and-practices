# Product Management

## A feature ticket should have the following:

* Overview describing what the feature is expected to do.
* Implementation details. How much detail you put here will depend on the developer/engineer/team, and how much the person writing the ticket 
knows(tech lead vs manager vs product manager). For on-shore experience developers/engineers you may just put a few notes, about what 
technology to use libraries to look at, classes that may be involved, or tables that may be involved, but you don't necessarily have to spell  
everything out, and you can leave something up to their discretion. For offshore and contractors you should be way more explicit and
spell things out, don't expect them to necessarily figure anything out on their own.
* How to test the feature. This may be filled in by development after implementation or may spell out specific things management would be looking for.
